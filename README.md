App Idea: Tip Transformer
Dining out is a universal experience, yet when it comes to the end of the meal and determining the tip, many find themselves fumbling with calculations. This idea of tip transformer provides a streamlined solution for tip calculation.

Tip Transformer would incorporate features beyond mere tip calculation. Key features would include:
Group Bill Splitter: Effortlessly divide the bill among friends, allowing for even or customized amounts per person.
Service Quality Meter: After rating their service experience, the app would suggest a corresponding tip amount.
Local Tipping Norms: For international travelers, the app would inform users of the standard tipping practices in the current country.
Expense Tracker: Keep a tab on dining expenses over time, aiding budgetary planning.

## Notes

Navigating through the options and functionalities that XCode offers was initially daunting. However, drawing parallels with my recent education in Java GUIs provided some solace. The overall design and interaction process in XCode showed remarkable similarities to the operations of JFrame GUIs, especially the ActionListeners and various UI elements. My experience in Java certainly bridged the learning curve.
