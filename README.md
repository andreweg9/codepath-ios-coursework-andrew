## Notes

Navigating through the options and functionalities that XCode offers was initially daunting. However, drawing parallels with my recent education in Java GUIs provided some solace. The overall design and interaction process in XCode showed remarkable similarities to the operations of JFrame GUIs, especially the ActionListeners and various UI elements. My experience in Java certainly bridged the learning curve.
